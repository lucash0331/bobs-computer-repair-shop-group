<h2 class="about-bob">About Bob's Computer Repair Shop</h2>
        <p class="about-text">
          In 2008, Bob started a computer repair shop to help pay for his son's college tuition.
          Since then Bob's Computer Repair Shop has grown over 600%. Bob was becoming overwhelmed
          with the number of phone calls he was receiving, so he hired four web development students from Bellevue University 
          to help create and maintain his website. At Bob's Computer Repair Shop we vow to keep your system up and running at its best, so that you can perform at your best!  
          Bob's Computer Repair Shop is your one stop shop for computer repairs, and
